# L1-norm-Sudoku
My re-implementation of the paper  "Linear Systems, Sparse Solutions, and Sudoku Prabhu Babu, Kristiaan Pelckmans
 Petre Stoica, Fellow, IEEE and Jian Li, Fellow, IEEE" using Matlab.


This makes use of CVX - http://cvxr.com/cvx/ -CVX is a Matlab-based modeling system for convex optimization.CVX turns Matlab into a modeling language,
allowing constraints and objectives to be specified using standard Matlab expression syntax.
